The plugin is widget ready and will appear in your "Appearance > Widgets" list. Simply drag and drop and the widget into any widget ready area, like your sidebar.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I name my Groups anything? =

Yes, they work just like regular WordPress categories. However, two word Group names like "My Cats" won't work. You can try "MyCats" or just "Cats".

= How do I specify the Group name in the shortcode? =

When you embed the shortcode via the generator on your Post/Page write panel you can specify the Group name in the popup screen. So to specify your "Cats" Group, you would write cats in the field provided. The shortcode would then show it as: `group="cats"`
